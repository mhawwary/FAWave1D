# FAWave1D
A set of MATLAB functions and scripts for performing Fourier analysis of the 1D Wave equation. The available discretization methods are Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) (linear/warped elements), Finite Difference (FD), Compact Difference (CD), and Dispersion Relation Preserving (DRP) schemes and Runge Kutta (RK) for time integration. It also includes explicit Bogey and Bailly filters in addition to Pade' filters. 

For Usage, please extract the results.tar.gz tarball and begin by running any scipt from the scripts folder.
